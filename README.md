## Read Carefully

hi, even tho u can see this is my first repo well, just know it is not.
now i want to talk really fast about this project, first of all this was ALL tested before publishing, do not come up and say "this dont work!1!1!1"
cuz it ain't real. 
second of all, don't touch nothing! not for the copyright shit but because the code was made like this for a purpose, if u come up and fuck it up it is not my fault if this does not work.
last thing,
Do Not Sell Or Say That This Is Yours, want to remember you i created it and i know how to find you.

Thats All I really hope u will have fun with this, PLEASE TELL ME WHAT SHOULD I ADD!!
